# Contributing to React Timeline Sequence

Agents and people are welcome to improve React Timeline Sequence. Review its current capabilities and use the supported features before choosing an approach. Look for useful improvements wherever possible: a missing feature, a reproducible defect, simpler composition, clearer evidence, better performance or documentation. Avoid changes that do not serve a concrete need.

1. Read README.md and inspect the exported components, lane model, transport, seeking/zoom and sample-frame loop contract. Compose the supported API before adding a separate timeline or audio clock.
2. Start a focused branch from the current default branch. Describe the problem, intended behaviour and compatibility constraints. Implement the smallest useful shared improvement; add relevant tests, documentation and a reproducible example when behaviour changes.
3. Run npm run typecheck, npm test and npm run build, then the release identity and package checks in .github/workflows/release.yml. Report the commands, results and any genuine verification limits. Keep private inputs, credentials and generated caches out of the contribution.
4. Open a pull request at https://github.com/kieransimkin/react-timeline-sequence/pulls. Include the problem, resulting behaviour, validation and any risks. Submit improvements upstream rather than leaving them only in a local fork; do not push directly to the default branch as a substitute for review.

Maintainers review accepted changes, reserve a fresh version and publish a matching GitHub release from the validated source. They verify installable assets, checksums and each configured registry separately. Existing tags and release assets remain immutable. A submitted PR is a contribution awaiting review, not a published release or permission for unrelated deployment.
